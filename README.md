## Abstract
Kinsee is a Machine Learning app that aims to extract keyframes from a workout, count the repetitions, and then evaluate one of three workouts using a Neural Network. Those workouts are sit-ups, pushups, and squats. We were able to achieve a 92% accuracy when trained on individuals, and 77% for a general model trained on n=4 individuals. Kinsee provides a proof of concept for an AI home-workout program. Using this method, we expect to be able to analyze a wide variety of exercises automatically.
